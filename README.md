# Implementation of the Basic Cellular Automatas
Based on the study of Theory of Cellular Automata, with the knowledge gathered I have implemented: 
1. **Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automata also called "The three-neighbor One Dimensional Null Boundary Problem".**
_Implementation is done on a 1-Dimensional vector, and I have used different logical operations as rules to make it simpler to understand. For the boundary elements we use 0 as neighbours (NULL boundary)._

2. **Different versions of John Conway's Game of Life (Basic implementation not simulation).**
  * Version 1: To produce the next generation matrix.
  * Version 2: To produce next 'n' generation matrices step by step.
  * Version 3: To produce the nth generation matrice directly.
